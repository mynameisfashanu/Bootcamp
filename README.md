### Process

* ABC - Always Be Coding.
* Code for at least 2 hour Every Day Outside work.
* Focus on one thing at a time.
* Don't Learn Security until you've mastered the fundamentals - (C#, HTTP, JS, SQL, MVC, Networking, SSL/HTTPS)
* Step 1 : Understand Concept - books, tutorials, videos, draw diagrams, explain the concept.
* Step 2 : Practice concept - Small exercises and challenges.
* Step 3 : Apply concept - Apply concept to a real life problem.
* Project Euler.
* Karan programming projects.
* Build a project based on the Concept you're trying to learn.
